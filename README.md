Script to get source code of a android apk

How to Use This Script
Install the Required Tools:

Install apktool, dex2jar, and a Java decompiler like JD-GUI.
Ensure they are accessible from your command line (add them to your system's PATH if necessary).
Run the Script:

Save the script as decompile_apk.py.
Run it using Python by passing the path of the APK file: python decompile_apk.py path/to/your/app.apk.
Manual Decompilation:

The script will create a .jar file. You need to manually open this file in a Java decompiler (like JD-GUI) to view the source code.
Important Notes
The script is basic and might need adjustments based on your specific environment or requirements.
Error handling is minimal, so you might want to enhance it for better robustness.
The script assumes that apktool and d2j-dex2jar commands are available in the system PATH.
The final step of viewing the decompiled source code in a Java decompiler is manual.
This script should serve as a starting point, and you might need to modify or expand it based on your specific needs and the complexity of the APK files you are working with.
